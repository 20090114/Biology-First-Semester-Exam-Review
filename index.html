      <p><b>1) </b>Draw an animal and a plant cell below with the correct shape: Label the following structures in your cells.<br>The structures could be in one cell or the other, or in both cells. Structures: <b>Nucleus, Cell wall, Cell membrane,<br> Chloroplast, Cytoplasm, Mitochondria</b><br>Animal Cell<br>---------------<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Plant Cell<br>--------------<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
      <p><b>2) </b>What is the difference between plant cells and animal cells? Why are these differences<br>needed?<br><i>The difference between plant cells and animal cells are the chloroplast, cell wall, and cell division/mitosis.<br>These Differences are needed because plants are green to help them grow but humans do not need to be green to help them<br>grow.</i></p>
      <p><b>3) </b>Give the evidence, and reasoning for the <b>Claim: Plants cells are better at conducting photosynthesis than human cells.</b><br><br><i>The evidence and reasoning for that claim is: plants have a chloroplast, that turns some parts of it green,<br>like leaves, when it is sunny for a long period of time.</i></p>
      <p><b>4) </b>What are the <b>INPUTS</b> of photosynthesis? Where do they come from? How do they get into the<br>tree?<br><i>The inputs are: sun, h2o, and co2. They come from the air, the rain, and the outer space thing respectively. They<br>get into the tree through the leaves/parts ofthe plants exposed to the air, but mainly leaves</i></p>
      <p><b>5) </b>Where does the light energy of the sun end up in plants after being converted in the chloroplasts? Draw a simple picture and pathway?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
      <p><b>6) </b>Plants seem like they are on a diet, but they are always gaining weight. Explain how they get their calories.<br><i>Plants get their calories from mostly co2 and glucose, but there are plants that are exceptions though</i></p>
      <p><b>7) </b>Why do plants need to be green even though humans are not?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
      <p><b>8) </b>How does climate affect the rate of photosynthesis in different plants?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
